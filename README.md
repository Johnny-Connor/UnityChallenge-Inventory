# About it

This was my attempt at a Unity developer test I found while I was looking for a job. As a relatively new developer, taking on this challenge was a good opportunity for me to evaluate my skills from the Labor Market's perspective.

Basically, I had to create a scene featuring a pixel-perfect inventory system in which you could do the requested commands using a Xbox controller. As a plus, I added keyboard compatibility, a cursor animation and some sound effects from Minecraft.

# Controls

* Arrow Keys/Joysticks or D-pad - Moves the cursor.

* A - Picks/Drops an item. If you drop an item in a slot that already contains another item, they will switch places.

* Y - Clears the inventory to create 5 random items in 5 random slots. If pressed while holding an item, it just discards the item you were holding instead.

* 1 + 2/Left + Right triggers - Cycle through the following resolutions: 1280x720, 1920x1080 and 3860x2160.
